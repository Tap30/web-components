# Components

Tapsi provides a set of UI components for building consistent interfaces. There are two versions available:

1. **Web Components** (`@tapsioss/web-components`): Framework-agnostic, can be used in any environment that supports Web Components.
2. **React Components** (`@tapsioss/react-components`): Tailored for React, offering a seamless integration into your React workflow.

::: info

 Both component packages rely on [Tapsiâ€™s Theme package](/theme) to ensure consistent styling and design tokens. Make 
 sure to install and import the Theme package.
