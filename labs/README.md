# ğŸ§ª Labs

The `labs/` directory is a space for experimental, in-progress, or
proof-of-concept packages that are not yet production-ready. Think of this as
our "R&D" area inside the monorepo.

## Purpose

- ğŸš§ Prototype new ideas without affecting core packages
- ğŸ§¬ Explore design system concepts, architectural proposals, or new APIs
- ğŸ›  Test integrations or isolated utilities before formalizing them
- ğŸ”¬ Collaborate on experimental features in a contained environment

Happy hacking! ğŸš€
